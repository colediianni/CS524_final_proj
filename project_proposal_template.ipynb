    "Our porject is about aligning images. One of the problems is finding a better metric for image differences. Specicfically, we found that the $L_2$ norm distance is too rigid so we aim to find a better metric. For example, a checkboard pattern of black and white tiles compares to the same pattern shifted over 1 pixel would be as dissimilar as possible according to the $L_2$ distance, but semantically has the same information. Thus, we're looking to develop a MIP which would allow pixels to shift and warp such that the $L_2$ distance between the source and target image is minimized while maintaining pixel ordering."
